# themarket

This repository is all of the code used to build an app that my team called The Market. The app enables Stanford students to buy and sell their items. 

Major features: 
- Search page that enables users to sort items based on specific words or categories
- Chat between users interested in buying/selling an item
- Customizable profile page
- Post page that allows a user to upload up to 5 images

You'll find most of the applicable code in the 'lib' folder within 'market code'.
